# DEEP-TIMING
Deep Learning Solution to TIMING (Time-lapse Microscopy in Nanowell Grids) Project created and maintained by [Single-Cell Lab](http://singlecell.chee.uh.edu/), [FARSight Group](http://www.farsight-toolkit.org/wiki/Main_Page), [STIM Laboratory](http://stim.ee.uh.edu/) and [HULA Lab](https://www.hvnguyen.com/hula-lab) at University of Houston, Houston, Texas.

## Introduction

Deep learning algorithms show top performance on image classification and object detection tasks over general-purpose image domains (IMAGENET, MSCOCO). This repository explores the performance of state-of-art image classifier and object detector on a different domain consisting of time-lapse microscopy images collected in TIMING project. Extended from the initial exploration, we created annotated TIMING datasets efficiently using man-in-the-loop fashion and our customized annotation tool, to support the fine-tuning of the deep learning models. And an end-to-end TIMING pipeline is developed to detect, track and quantify cells with robustness and flexibility.

## Highlights

*High-quality annotated TIMING Data


*Cell detection leveraging phase-contrast channel and Faster R-CNN algorithm


*Label-free apoptosis classification using CNN and LSTM Models


*Customized visualization tool from TIMING2-board
