# DEEP-TIMING
Deep Learning Solution to TIMING (Time-lapse Microscopy in Nanowell Grids) Project 

## Introduction

Deep learning algorithms show top performance on image classification and object detection tasks over general-purpose image domains (IMAGENET, MSCOCO). This repository explores the performance of state-of-art image classifier and object detector on a different domain consisting of time-lapse microscopy images collected in TIMING project. Extended from the initial exploration, we created annotated TIMING datasets efficiently using man-in-the-loop fashion and our customized annotation tool, to support the fine-tuning of the deep learning models. And an end-to-end TIMING pipeline is developed to detect, track and quantify cells with robustness and flexibility.
